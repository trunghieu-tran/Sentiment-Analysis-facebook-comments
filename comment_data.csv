60,United States presidential election 2016,Former Mexican president slams Trump's 'stupid wall',"Hillary thinks saying 'everybody accepts big money' somehow exonerates her from being part of the establishment problem. She is the leading tip of the rigged system, getting the most Wall Street money, while having the fewest individual supporters. She's living in a skewed reality bubble with the other establishment money cronies.Also, Bill Clinton and Obama were never Secretary of State and both had no foreign policy experience. Yet, they did great. And Bernie would never pick someone like Hillary to be secretary with her poor judgement. So clearly, foreign policy experience is NOT needed for the job. Period.

It is now a general understanding by the public that the HK Police will not arrest those people because they are coomunities with strong pro~china political influences and supporters of our current Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying, these people sort of became like those of ""untouchables"" .",0.130877551,0.092972789

You know that I have started a series in the facebook imparting brahma vidya, the knowledge of truth, as given in 108 Upanishads!My long professional experience in teaching and research in many fields other than vedas, unfortunately, encouraged me to write in various social media platforms on diverse issues as education, economic development, religious amity, anti-national activities of opposition parties, media and religious fanatics etc! After studying vedas and getting engaged in imparting veda knowledge, I should really refrain from all other activites that can cause distractions and affect my main Vedic work.So I have decided to concentrate only on spreading the veda message across the world! My posts are public and people are free to read my posts and use the knowledge to rise themselves to a higher level! Those who choose to criticize the Vedas too are free to do so! Vedas need not be defended by anyone; if intellectual debates over 5000 years have accepted vedas as the basic premises, nothing more is needed to defend them!In short, no more posts from me on topics other than Vedas and related literature; of course, all important scientific discoveries and concepts supporting the Veda assertions will be presented! No more presidential election, Donald Trump, Modiji, Kejriwal, Mughal and British invaders, dismal education system etc. from me! Only vidya and no avidya! Be certain, avidya is the root cause of all evils in the world! There is one final request: those who like my series may do the needful to spread this divine veda message to others!

Hair up, hair down, hat, no hat, its the same people. She supply's her own crowds. Don't you get it? Its the Clinton foundation. Its what it was designed for. Its not a charity its an election machine designed to fool the masses...please do your own research. Here is an example. If you watch the news your aware of the water crisis in flint Michigan, and you have probably seen Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton talking about it. Hillary talks about it in her speeches, she talks about it on her Facebook page, she talks about it in the television interviews.... She expresses great concerns over it...but all she does is talk, talk, talk, talk. Look, if you go to Walmart and buy a single bottle of water and send it to a random resident of flint Michigan then you all by yourself would be doing more for that resident than the Clinton campaign and Clinton foundation COMBINED!!!! Ask yourself, why is Chelsea always doing something other than working at the foundation? She make $600K a year.

All of a sudden I heard them having in depth political conversation about the direction this country is going. They were talkin about Bernie Sanders. They said they really liked him.  They didn't like him cause he has style or because he's cool.  They like him because they are tired of the wars their generation is fighting.  They're afraid of the Next War having a draft. They believe in his message.  Having been in military conflicts. w 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne). Trainig Contras in Nicaragua. I can empathize.  I agree wall street is rigged. I agree banks need to be broke up the way Republican President Teddy Rosevelt did with the first anti trust laws to break up momopolies.I think we need a masive shake up in DC and wall street.  We need Campaign Finance reform to remove ""McCain/Feingold"" and ""Citizens United.""  I think Hillary is too close to the problem to be able to fix it.  I have trust issues.  Why won't she release the transcipts to all the speaches she gave to the banks??  Cause they love her and she thinks the banks have been midunderstood???  She has Super Pacs and big$ banks financing her campaign.  Bernie has over 3 million individual campaign donors averaging $27.00 each.  And he's pulling in as much as her.  That alone proves Super Pacs are not necessary. The power is still eih the people who vote. Bernie has experience of 30 yrs fom Mayor to Congress to the Senate.  He knows his way around.This election means alot to everyone. But not as much as it does to our Youth. I have to consider the welfare of my kids  It may be the most important election of our lifetime but especially theirs. WW3 is coming trust me! With a draft including women. There's a bill in the house right now to add women to the draft.  Why if they don't expect a big war would they need a draft?  This election is the biggest of our lives and I have to consider my kids and the future.  Too often we live in the here  and now without thinking ahead.  Iraq is an example.  G.W. didn't think about the 10 yrs down the road or the power vacuum attacking Iraq would leave.  Bush Sr. and Col. Colin Powell did.  It's why they stopped short of Bagdad in Desert Storm and set up no fly zones that were working.  I think like a soldier.  I smell death, you never forget, I see the blood, the death of children.  I see their bodies in the street bloading. So many that they rot for days weeks before we can bury them.  The sickening sweet smell of dead bodies is everywhere.  Then there's the wide spread distruction.  The desimation of historical sights that have lived through a thousand years of war til this one.  Thousands of years of history that lynks us all together... gone forever.  Our kids and grand kids will never be able to see these beautiful historic sights or learn about them.  They're gone now.  War is a terrible terrible thing and too often we set here insulated from it and forget it's even going on.  Comfortable in our warm homes while the war rages on.  Then there's the war that comes home with them.  PTSD, Maimed, loss of limbs etc. It never ends for many of them.  The last war generation.  (Vietnam)  Brought us Kennedy and Johnson. It was the young college aged kids that voted for them. Did they make a mistake?  I ask only because Hilary. Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinberg has insinuated that's what our young people are doing now. Telling them they're just following Bernie Sanders for the boys or going to hell if they don't vote for Hillary. I am going with my gut. I'm supporting my kids.  My life is set.  I wont have to fight.  I'll be ok.  They wont and they have their whole lives ahead of them.  I don't want to see it snuffed out for a unjust war that started on lies of WMDs.  We had a right to get Bin Laden in Afghanistan, that was a just war. We should have stayed focussed there and Laden would have been caught long long before.  Bernies strategy for the Middle East  makes sense .  He wants to commit no US troops  on the ground .  We can give air support  intelligence  and financing .  The only U.S. ground troops will be Special Forces in an advisory capacity .  All ground fighting will be done by a coalition  of neighboring Muslim nations .  The Saudis  the Jordanians  the Turks  and the Egyptians. If United States were to invade it would be perceived by terrorist as a holy war... Christians against Muslims. And that is exactly what ISIS wants. The war must be fought Muslim against Muslim in order for it to be viewed as a just war to them. They have to clean up their own backyard. No more young American men and women shedding their blood for a war that should have never taken place had Middle East not been destabilized by the Iraqi invasion. Bernies plan makes sense and his attitude, fortitude, experience and judgment is what we need as our Commander and Chief right now. This is my oppinion.  It's why I support Bernie and I hope you will join me! Feel The Bern!!",0.10015082,0.08504918

14574,United States presidential election 2016,"The Polling Snapshot: Heading to New Hampshire, poll overload","The Democratic Party is a classic caste system. First you have their Lower Class peoples. This is the engine that subjugates low income people, minorities and immigrants by forcing them to live on minimum wages, public housing, welfare, food stamps, and free medical benefits on the most impoverished people in this county with no viable means or legitimate avenue to obtain a fair and equitable living. These people have been in this classification for their entire lives. They have less education, fewer people are given the opportunities. Now they need and want to incorporate and legalize over 11 million illegal immigrants who have invaded our country and begin a process of bringing hundreds of thousands of Arabic people to add to this group.Then you have their consolidated middle class. This is their engine of union workers across all industries, individual family farmers, agricultural workers, and minority business owners. Union workers are afforded the benefits of Prevailing Wages and Fringe benefits. Prevailing wages are established in each and every job classification that exists. The pay and benefits given to Union members is 3 times to 5 times more income then their lower class voters. Those in their middle class are generally homeowners, receive guaranteed pay and benefits during an entire career and their jobs are protected politically. Farmers and agricultural workers receive farm and crop subsidies. This is arguably the largest welfare plan ever devised in this country. If crops fail, don't worry about it...they'll simply be paid a subsidy through the Farmer Bureau at the end of the season. If they have a great year, don't worry about it...we'll still pay you the same subsidies. If a company with union employees looks like it's going to fail, don't worry...we'll bail you out so our union voting base remains intact. The makeup of most Unions in our country are white males and women by an extremely huge margin. Unions spend millions supporting Democrats across this country. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have received millions from unions over their careers as have most Democratic politicians. ""Cometh to the well and you shall drink!""But above all else is the Upper Class. These are the rich, the bankers, the automakers, the owners of the majority of newspapers, broadcasting companies and the manufacturing corporations. This rich in the Democratic party are amount the richest Americans in the history of our county. Two simple examples here would be Warren Buffet and his Berkshire Hathaway fund. Arguable one one of the most powerful men in our country. There will never be a pipeline build as long as Burlington Northern Santa Fee railroad is carrying millions of barrels of oil to the refineries. No bank that supports the Democratic Party will be allowed to fail. Evidenced by the fact Goldman Sachs is one of the greatest donors for Hillary Clinton. ""Cometh to the well and you shall drink!""This is the Democratic caste system as a whole. The largest majority of the Lower class are destined to remain in this class their entire lives with little hope of ever moving out of it. The Democratic Party need this class to win elections. They do so to win elections because those in the lower class are less educated and would never be allowed to move up into the middle class. They will simply never be given the means. There has never been an election where the Democratic Party and those politicians running have not promised the end their lives in this Lower class. There has never been any progress for these people as a group after any election. What is even more sad....in the past 8 years, under Obama...the total number of people in the Lower class has grown. The rich did get richer, but they are destroying the middle class to ensure they have their largest voting base guaranteed.

2044,United States presidential election 2016,Why these Obama voters are backing Donald Trump,"its funny how the uneducated simply looks at the time frame of WHEN it occurred. yet dont look at the history of WHY it occurred. Nafta, and the china treaties caused companies to run overseas and south of the border, while at the same time Clinton was forcing banks and lenders to give loans to ppl who were already spotty on credit to begin with. as factories got built and up to operating shipping parts and goods to the states. those same ppl started losing jobs to foreign competition. therefore, unemployment will NOT pay a mortgage or car payment so then they default on them. The bubble burst on it way after Clinton left office and has been unfairly given to Bush, when in fact it was all started with the signing of those liberal policies of Bill Clinton....... ppl tall about how good the economy was under Clinton well guess what? the reason is he INHERITED an economy set up by the previous administrations of Presidents, Reagan and Bush sr. was nothing Clinton did. The term Reaganomics was designed and further implemented by Bush for the pupose of making America great again, and worked until Clinton and his liberal cohorts decided to prop up China and Mexico and send OUR jobs overseas...... a vote for trump is the only sane choice",0.09756,0.11988

But that's just the beginning, Obama has wade America though the greatest economic depression, greater than 1929; we still had Lehman Brothers, Merrrill Lynch, Bear Stearns.  These are the pillars of American financial power around the world, Lehman Bros was the only bank to sell bonds to build entire state economies in the South, after the Civil War ended.  They were the reason there is a Sear and Roebuck, many other iconic brands that existed for 130 years.  Yet in one month Bear Steans, Lehman, Merrill all fell like dominos.  This is known as systemic risk.  Had the US govt not raised $750 B and bailed out these and AIG the unemployment rate easily could have been 20% like in Spain not 10.7%.   So despite the uninformed who say our government policies do not work, the FDIC created in 1936 and other policies tightening Federal Reserve worked.  The long soup lines of 1929-19134 were avoided, the unemployment was 22% in 2009 unemployment peaked at 10.7%.  Today its 4.9%, even though labor participation rate is low, this very low unemployment level will force wage growth and push those who have given up on jobs to get back in the game.  The evidence of this is beginning to mount.  Trumps polices is ever implemented will tank the economy.

29253,United States presidential election 2016,"CNN to hold Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Michigan","Bernie Sanders has proposed a total solution: It works like this - instead of actually working at a job, your government just gives you stuff so you can stop working. You sit at home, filling out disability claims, and at some point the evil Capitalist system collapses from all the useless pressure and weight on it.  Now, Instead of real results and profits, it's all debt, which becomes the justification to raise taxes - on the rich.   But, the coolest thing about Socialism is debt comes with it automatically, and so do tax rates of 50%.  To deal with it, the government just keeps printing more money, which leads to greater inflation, so you get more and more people to go on strike, so they don't have to work. Some people will insist on producing, so you raise their taxes to 80% and make them slaves to your government.",0.108050909,0.09788

Narcism is being confused with brains & boldness. Everything about Donald Trump gives me hope in America again. I am tired of illegal immigrants. Yes I am. I am stupified to why they are given a better way of life than our Vets who fought for the very freedom we enjoy!! Trump will end that. 
Trump will bring back jobs. Trump will bring back entrepenurship and small businesses and manufacturing. Trump will bring back order to the streets: cops won't be ridiculed!
What is wrong with money? Absolutely nothing. Trump doesnt need anyone's $ he can't be bought and that is a G-d given gift. You need $ to live. In Trumps book ""The Art of the Deal"" he states he doesn't work for money because he has enough money. Wasnt King Soloman the wealthiest ruler?  Trump loves work and he is in excellent health at 70 to keep going. He has a very clear, forthright head on his shoulders another G-d given gift. The bible says you work hard, you will be rewarded. Trump's life is an American blueprint for success. Remember, God made Trump and I believe, exactly for this pre-destined moment in history.
Trump can run a successful company, he can run a successful America.
Trump is a friend of Israel. He & Bibi are great friends. Trump campaigned for Bibi during the last elections in Israel (a little publicized fact). Bibi won by a narrow margin last year.
Trump will move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel where it should be. 
Trump knows too well the Christian beheadings & the war called ISIS and he will destroy that cancer before they destroy us. He is anti-mosques where hate is encouraged & the war against Christians is fostered. He will reform taxes. ISIS is a political agenda hidden behind religion.
I find everything about Donald J Trump refreshing. Shall I go on ?
He will give freedom to churches to speak anti-same sex marriages and teach sin without fear of closure.
He will put G-d back in schools.
He will not back Shariah Law.
He protects the 2nd amendment.
He will restructure mental health care in this country.
He will do away with Obamacare (such a great bill you need a law to enforce it!!) The pharmaceuticals can't buy him.
He will certainly fight for equality in the workplace.
I believe he will dismantle Planned Parenthood. He doesn't need their $.
In our world, knowledge is power & money is freedom! Trump has both in aces!! That's why I'm voting for President Trump!!! If the dems win they will be the death of Christianity. Our society will be socialistic. In socialism there is no G-d. Consider that.  
Trump has a lot of work to do. He is the best one to get the job done. Let's support him so he can

1669,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"(Re-posted re: #GOPDebate): NOT SO FAST, FOLKS! (Pun, sorry.) VOTER INSIDER PLATINUM and you're missing it???? This was fascinating. I have a theory: What does each candidate's behavior ""behind the scenes"" actually reveal? Replay the footage. Who went off script? Yeaaaahhhh, interesting coincidence, isn't it? Who used his weight to take control and stand beside his fellow candidate? And who, anxious to stay on cue and look sharp, continued to breeze past Dr. Carson? Stay with me. Now I could be mistaken, but isn't it possible that Mr. Trump, who has loads of TV experience, may have noticed that Dr. Carson missed the cue and, rather than thinking only of himself, decided to skip his cue deliberately and stand beside Dr. Carson (in a no-sweat-man-they'll-wait-we've-got-this-sort-of-symbolic-gesture)? Then, completely at ease, indeed waited for the next cue and let Dr. Carson actually go FIRST (the Only candidate to so thoughtfully and successfully do that ). What was interesting was to see how anxious other candidates were to move ahead and ""look the part "" or follow ""their cue."" Am I the only person that's struck by the symbolism here? Indeed it was a simple gesture, but I think it revealed more about Mr. Trump than the media is acknowledging. He tried to take a ""negative"" and re-brand it. I think the anecdote also says something about how much he admires Dr. Carson. What would have been even MORE fascinating to see perhaps is whether Mr. Trump would have stopped and done the same had it been another candidate. Moreover, nothing against Mr. Rubio, whom I admire and consider very talented, but a worried look crossed his face moments later that was intriguing to me; he's so perceptive that I actually wonder if he began experiencing regret that he didn't do what Mr. Trump did, realizing he walked ahead of Dr. Carson too. In other words, who really led here? Which of these men truly has the most confidence? Who took control of the narrative? Who helped his colleague? Who refused to let the script dictate the next move or rattle his poise? It sounds like a small thing -- but actually, it wasn't. It revealed something -- behind the scenes, a place that voters rarely get to observe. So people can tease ABC News all they want -- I'm actually grateful for the valuable insight. AND TO DR. CARSON'S CREDIT, his reaction also revealed things to me. It's my theory that he wasn't about to walk out on stage as another man's name was being called -- nor simply because a television producer was giving him instructions. He'd missed a cue but he didn't panic or react nervously; he remained poised and was intellectually assessing what his work-around would look like, which makes sense to me; he's a neurosurgeon after all. It's rather absurd for people to question how talented and intelligent this man is. It takes confidence not to panic when the script changes -- and to reach out and lend a hand, even at one's own expense (remember that debate Mr. Trump skipped --while he was raising support, awareness, for our veterans?). Honestly, it's a great quality in a leader. I learned a lot listening to the debate. But I may have learned even a little more DURING THE INTROS. Cc: Donald J.

He keeps insulting Trump, even when his territorial exposure is severely limited, compared to Trump, who is vastly traveled across the globe, own assets in many continents. Trump is an independent right wing American gladiator interested in leadership to recreate America, in his own image as, Independent, prosperous and extremely powerful to scare others to submission. He sounds passionately American and desires to see an America that manifest economic might and vastly wealthy... dominating the global economy and political landscape.  No matter how absurd Trump sounds, he seem a lot more candid than many of his opponents. I don't share his views at all but, one can't den how impressive his appeal is among many Americans.  Trump is brutally blunt and candid, unlike Bush who struggles with how best to couch his arguments to win points.

22047,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"Mary Lou S. Holmes, everything that you think you know about Trump is wrong!  His grandfather, a German immigrant, earned his money running brothels. Fred Trump, Donald's father, became a multi-millionaire through building Section 8 housing for welfare recipients.  Donald Trump was BORN wealthy, & is such a ""great businessman"", that he went to great lengths to disinherit his late brother's children from their share of their grandfather's fortune by persuading the grandfather to change his will. His 3 marriages to successively younger women speaks to his family values. ""Sharia law"" is unconstitutional, as is any official state religion.  No church, synagogue or mosque faces closure because of their teachings on same-sex marriage, just public unpopularity from society at large. Obamacare is just an effort to bring affordable health insurance to more Americans, something that should be a right of citizenship, like it is in EVERY industrialized country in the world, save ours. It is an effort to insure more people while appeasing the insurance companies. All hospitals must, by law (passed under Reagan), care for patients.  They pass the costs for the uninsured to the insured & taxpayers, raising everyone's rates. Why would he fight for equality in the workplace when he has made a career of hiring foreign workers through applying for visas. As for your fears about Christianity, you are wrong. Our Democrats are moderate & if you knew anything about American history, you would know that socialism in this country was founded by Christians & was, at one time, more prevalent.  Socialism is not the same as communism, which is atheistic in nature. No Democrat, no matter how liberal, has ever proposed anything like that. And caring for the poor, the sick, the elderly & the young are Christian values. The worship of money & the ""Gospel of Prosperity"" are NOT the teachings of Christ!",0.14346930946291556,0.08261892583120199

Any symbol, group or organization that expounds these ideas has no place in our society.We will never forget Auschwitz,we will never forget the people that died or die at the hands of racism.We should all be proactive In fighting the evil social construct of racism. We haven't moved forward because we still retain some of the racist infrastructure of the past,we recently removed many confederate monuments all over the south which is great step forward but we still have to eradicate the racist groups and all confederate symbols. May The history teachers never let us forget,but its our duty as a society to remove these threats that hinder the liberty and well being of all human beings and the true freedom of a society.I call on all Americans to peacefully and ideologically fight racism,prejudice and discrimination.Our youth are the key to this battle and they are doing a great job,we must create a culture of disdain for all things racist.We as Americans must rip apart this evil status quo by uniting against all things that continue to let it taint our society.I don't believe ""everyone is racist"" that is a myth,a social construct, I do believe Everyone is equal,I do believe that all people all over the world are members of one giant family called humanity and I believe that every person on this earth has the right to pursue their dreams and reap the benefits of what they sow and that only cowards and fools would try to hinder anyone of this right based on the color of their skin.Let it be known throughout all America that there is a New culture arising,a culture that will treat all people equally,a culture where all people will enjoy the fruits of their labor,and a culture where those who perpetrate racism will be severely severly punished!In my eyes unfairly hindering a persons success or opportuinites based on their skin or sex is one of the most cowardly,weak,and evil things a person can do to someone.Racist people take the wealth,opportunities and life out of people with this kind of behavior,and the slightest hint of this behavior must not be tolerated and must be destroyed.This type of behavior is a disgusting immoral cancer of our society and it is up to all of us to stop this mindset by changing our society and culture to one that absolutely despises racism on all levels.We won the civil war,we are making changes with women's pay,voting,and military service,we have taken confederate monuments down in the south we are winning!Lets be redundant and continue the fight!!Lets make racial entitlements null and void,I would even say lets disban all racially based organizations of all colors and create centers of humanity,culture,and unity,America Centers,were we all may unite and grow as a nation,thank you and god bless America!",0.1427209039548022,0.08038757062146888

I have never seen anyone, so shallow, go so far. Get past the angry aggressive attitude. Be fair to yourself. John Kasich is the only Republican that has the ability, ideals and capability to run this Country. That's even close to Hilary, which is still second to her. W/ Hilary's experiences, First Lady, Secretary of State and Senate, Along w/ Her husbands record as president ( who will be in the White House w/ her). There is no one, that even comes close, to having more knowledge, back ground and success w/ the economy, foreign policy, global warming and world threat than the two of them. For those that, justifiably, hold Bill's indiscretion against him. I say it was wrong, but, if Hilary has accepted it, than so can I for the benefit of the Country..Also, Benghazi was a horrible mistake. It's hard to overcome.

(None of them even mention Bernie Sanders, who is actually ahead of Clinton in the polls!) I'm a liberal Democrat, but I have renewed respect for Jeb Bush for trying to bring some dignity and substance to the presidential race.
